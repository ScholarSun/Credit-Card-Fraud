In this project, we are presented with an anomaly detection problem. In this read me, I will try and explain my thought process in model selection, data analysis and visualization. The notebook itself has some commentary in between steps as well to improve the flow.

Note: the classification notebook is supposed to be read after the anomaly detection notebook.
